# longest-common-substring
Now, it's not the most elegant solution, I know, but I'm proud of this work. Yes, the main function is huge, and I'm not supposed to do that. I tried creating helper functions but it was more work than it was worth to do that. So, if you have any suggestions as to how I can improve my code I'm all ears.
